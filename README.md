# Portfolio

A modern and lightweight personal portfolio, implemented with a clean **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** stack.  
The purpose of the project is to showcase my skills in front-end development, user interface refinement, and accessibility.

## ✨ Features

- Clear and responsive single-page portfolio
- Projects are retrieved from a JSON file (easy to maintain and expand)
- Project cards open in a modal
- Search and filter projects
- Dark/light theme (remembered in `localStorage`)
- Accessibility taken into account (keyboard support, focus states, semantic HTML)
- Contact form via Formspark
- Separate "Thank you" page after submitting the form

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **HTML5** – semantic and clear structure
- **CSS3** – modern layout (Grid, Flexbox), themes, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – UI logic, state, theme management, and modals  
- **Formspark** – form processing without a backend  

No frameworks – intentionally lightweight and easy to read.
