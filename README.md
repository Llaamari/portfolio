# Portfolio

A lightweight, modern portfolio (HTML/CSS/JS) that:
- loads projects from the `data/projects.json` file
- includes search + filtering
- opens projects in a modal
- supports dark/light themes + remembers your selection
- is responsive and accessible

## Development
Open `index.html` in your browser or use a small dev server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
